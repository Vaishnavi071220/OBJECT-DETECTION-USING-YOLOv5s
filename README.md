The objective of this project is to fine-tune a YOLOv5 object detection model to detect and classify
two specific object categories (Trees, Lights) in a custom dataset. We choose YOLOv5 as it provides a more effective and
scalable solution for object detection tasks. YOLOv5â€™s architecture allows for faster training and
inference times, making it highly suitable for detecting multiple objects in diverse scenes with
limited data. The dataset was collected at the University of New Haven. Post training, we achieved 65.8% precision, 69.6% recall, mAP@0.5 was 67.1%, mAP@0.5:.95 was 32.3%.
